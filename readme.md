## Restaurant Management System

The intended product will assist restaurant staff in being able to manage all of the customers visiting their restaurant, ensuring that those visiting arrive in safe numbers and that their contact details are saved in order to help health professionals with tracking and tracing. This restaurant management system will enable staff to make and remove bookings on the system, storing necessary customer details. This will allow staff to manage available tables for bookings at the restaurant for each hour â€“ with tables being set and changeable by the restaurant owner. It will additionally display opening times for each day so bookings can be made in accordance with daily opening hours, again modifiable for the restaurant owner's needs. In addition, staff members will be able to search for specific bookings in order to contact customers where necessary, or to remove bookings off of the system. The system will make it easier for the restaurant to keep bookings under control, ensure that customers are following the latest government health guidelines and will make the lives of health experts easier, in order to help stop the spread of the virus.
